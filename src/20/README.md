## 20 simple single thread web server

This is a web server, a simple, single threaded one.
It can respond on GET request if the file is in the www subfolder.

Use this to play around and improve;

* remove the memory bug at Ctrl-C
* make it non-blocking and multi-threaded
* add a POST to drop files to the server
* add page that returns interesting files from the server
