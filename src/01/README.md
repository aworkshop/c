# Hello World!

## Explaining 01/main.c

Start with the following code and save as `main.c` using a text editor;
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

When we build and run this, it prints the format string.
```
$ ./main
Hello, World!
$
```

Lets go to the next example, and tell more how this works.
