## 04_echo.c

This code is just showing two other functions that are in the stdio.h header.

The while loop stops at the question mark. But you notice that the terminal
was waiting for the enter key before it started processing the input.

```
$ gcc 04_echo.c -o put
$ ./put
When will it stop? It stopped already!
When will it stop?
$
```

Please have a look what is defined in this stdio.h.
